(ns tenso.app
  "etzhayyim-wasm-tenso-t3ns0f1l appview — reagent + re-frame, view built
  from jp-go-dds (デジタル庁デザインシステム) hiccup.

  This is a faithful port of the previous SvelteKit scaffold
  (`svelte/src/routes/+page.svelte`): a static info page describing this
  appview surface itself — its title/project/name/kind, its declared route
  count and public routes, its declared runtime vars, whether xrpc is
  configured, and the source path of the page that renders all of this.
  The Svelte page never called the dispatcher Worker (`../src/app.ts`) — it
  was pure static markup describing the surface's own metadata, and this
  port adds no file-transfer functionality that was not already there.

  The Svelte scaffold's `routeCount`/`routes`/`vars` fields were stale empty
  literals (0 / [] / []); this port corrects them from the component's
  actual `wrangler.jsonc` (`routes[].pattern` and the `vars` map keys), same
  as the landed reference this was copied from
  (`kotoba-lang/app-playwright`'s `etzhayyim-wasm-playwright-pl4y1t8r/cljs`,
  itself following `cloud-itonami/app-tia`'s `tia-mcp-component/cljs`).

  Backend TypeScript is unaffected by this migration:
  `../src/app.ts` and `../src/genko-stub.ts` (production Worker code) are
  untouched. The one other TypeScript file that lived under the deleted
  `svelte/` tree — `svelte/src/routes/xrpc/[...path]/+server.ts`, a
  SvelteKit server route that proxied XRPC calls to
  AGENTGATEWAY_MCP_ROUTER_URL — was backend/XRPC logic, not frontend
  markup, so it was moved rather than deleted; see `../src/xrpc-proxy.ts`
  for its unmodified body and a note on why it is not wired to anything
  right now."

;; -- db ------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Mirrors the `const app = {...}` object the Svelte scaffold declared
;; inline in its <script> block, field for field. The only field that
;; changes value is :relative-path — it is self-referential ("where does
;; this page's own source live"), and the source moved from
;; svelte/src/routes/+page.svelte to here. :route-count, :routes, and :vars
;; are corrected from wrangler.jsonc (the Svelte scaffold had stale
;; routeCount 0 / empty routes / empty vars arrays there).
